# 🔍 AI-Powered Natural Language Search for PostgreSQL  

This project implements a **Natural Language Search Interface** using **Streamlit** and **OpenAI** to convert user queries into SQL and retrieve data from **PostgreSQL** efficiently. It also incorporates **vector search** using `pgvector` for enhanced text-based similarity searches.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
Many business applications rely on structured databases (like PostgreSQL) but struggle to provide an intuitive way for users to query data. This project enables users to **ask questions in natural language** (e.g., *"Show me all employees in the Engineering department earning above 50,000"*), and the system **translates it into SQL** to fetch relevant results.  

### ✅ **Key Features**  
✔️ **LLM-Powered SQL Generation**: Uses OpenAI to convert user queries into SQL.  
✔️ **Hybrid Search**: Combines traditional SQL filtering with **vector similarity search** (`pgvector`).  
✔️ **Secure Execution**: Query validation to prevent SQL injection risks.  
✔️ **User-Friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience.
